title: "AWS Authentication and S3 Operations Guides"
---

Welcome to the homepage for AWS access configuration and data management resources.  
This collection of guides provides step-by-step instructions for securely managing AWS authentication (using MFA or SSO) and for operating with Amazon S3 using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).  

Each guide is designed to help users configure secure AWS environments, automate access through scripts or profiles, and perform efficient data operations across AWS services.  

## AWS Access and Security Configuration Guides

Tutorial-style guides demonstrating secure authentication methods and credential management for AWS users.

- **AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Setup and Usage**
   - [Guide](aws-mfa-setup.md)  
   Learn how to enable and use AWS MFA for secure, temporary session credentials.  
   This guide explains how to:
   - Configure MFA devices (virtual or hardware)  
   - Create and use the `aws_mfa.sh` script for automatic token-based authentication  
   - Integrate temporary credentials into your shell or Jupyter notebooks  
   - Implement best practices for session management and credential security  
   <br>

- **AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) Configuration with AWS Identity Center**
   - [Guide](AWS_SSO_Setup_Guide.md)  
   Step-by-step instructions for setting up and using AWS Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) for passwordless, secure access.  
   This guide includes:
   - AWS CLI SSO configuration walkthrough  
   - Using browser-based authentication  
   - Managing multiple AWS accounts and IAM roles  
   - Daily login and logout workflow for SSO sessions  
   - Best practices for avoiding plain-text credentials and ensuring secure session management  
   <br>

## AWS Data Operations and Management

Practical reference for working with Amazon S3 using the AWS CLI, including data upload, access control, and cost optimization.

- **AWS S3 Commands and Operations Guide**
   - [Guide](aws-s3-commands-guide.md)  
   A complete reference of commonly used AWS S3 CLI commands for bucket and object management.  
   Key sections include:
   - CLI installation and configuration  
   - File operations (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `sync`)  
   - Recursive uploads and downloads  
   - Access control, encryption, and bucket policies  
   - Performance and cost management techniques  
   - Security best practices and troubleshooting methods  
   <br>

## Best Practices Summary

When working with AWS authentication and S3:
- Use **temporary credentials** through MFA or SSO — avoid storing permanent keys.  
- Enable **encryption and versioning** for critical S3 data.  
- Regularly **rotate access keys** and restrict IAM permissions by least privilege.  
- Test access with `aws sts get-caller-identity` and validate your session before running commands.  
- Review **CloudTrail** and **CloudWatch** logs to monitor activity.  

## Community-Contributed Scripts and Tools

Community utilities and automation scripts for enhanced AWS usability may be added here in the future.  
These will include:
- MFA and SSO integration helpers  
- Automated credential refreshers  
- Advanced S3 sync and cost-analysis scripts
