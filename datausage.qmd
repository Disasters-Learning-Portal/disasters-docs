title: "NASA Disasters: Case Studies"
---

Welcome to the NASA Disasters Learning Portal case studies. These Jupyter notebooks demonstrate how to access, visualize, and analyze disaster-related data for real-world events. Each case study walks through data acquisition, processing, and analysis techniques relevant to disaster response and monitoring.

## Featured Case Studies

These case studies showcase practical applications of satellite data and geospatial analysis for disaster monitoring and response.
