Something you know (your password/credentials) 2. Something you have (a time-based token from your MFA device)\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced Security: Temporary credentials automatically expire, reducing the risk if they’re compromised\nCompliance: Many organizations require MFA for production AWS access\nBest Practice: AWS recommends using temporary credentials instead of long-lived access keys\nSession Management: Temporary credentials can be scoped with specific permissions\n\n\n\n\nThe ~/aws_mfa.sh script is a lightweight utility that you call with aws_env to: - Automatically detect your current AWS user - Find your configured MFA device - Generate temporary 12-hour session credentials - Export them to your current shell environment - Optionally save them for use in Jupyter notebooks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS CLI (version 2.x recommended)\n# Check if AWS CLI is installed\naws --version\n\n# Install AWS CLI on macOS\nbrew install awscli\n\n# Install AWS CLI on Linux\ncurl \"https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip\" -o \"awscliv2.zip\"\nunzip awscliv2.zip\nsudo ./aws/install\nBash Shell (standard on macOS and Linux)\n# Check bash version\nbash --version\nPython (optional, for Jupyter notebook integration)\n# Check Python installation\npython --version\n\n\n\n\n\nIAM User Account with:\n\nProgrammatic access enabled\nMFA device configured\nAppropriate permissions for your tasks\n\nMFA Device Setup\n\nVirtual MFA device (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)\nHardware MFA token (YubiKey, RSA SecurID, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate or edit ~/.aws/credentials:\n[smce-veda]\naws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID\naws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\nNOTE: These credentials are obtained within the AWS console when you register for an AWS account.

    "text": "About the Data: Sentinel-2 True Color/Color IR\nThe True Color RGB composite provides a product of how the surface would look to the naked eye from space. The RGB is created using the red, green, and blue channels of the respective instrument.\nThe Color Infrared composite is created using the near-infrared, red, and green channels, allowing for the ability to see areas impacted by the fires. The near-infrared gives the ability to see through thin clouds. Healthy vegetation is shown as red, water is in blue.\nThese data will allow us to view the burn scar caused by the fire and compare it to the pre-fire landscape.",

    "section": "About the Data: Normalized Burn Ratio Difference (dNBR)",
    "text": "About the Data: Normalized Burn Ratio Difference (dNBR)\nNBR is defined mathematically as (NIR – SWIR)/(NIR + SWIR) where NIR is near-infrared and SWIR is short-wave infrared. dNBR is computed by the difference between the pre-fire NBR and the post-fire NBR. NBR is commonly used as a proxy to indicate areas which have charred vegetation. Darker areas (more negative values) in the NBR image more strongly represent the presence of burned vegetation. Since the dNBR considers the condition of the scene before the fire occurred, the resulting value has been used as a proxy for burn severity. Higher dNBR values represent a proxy for greater burn severity. Negative dNBR values may represent a re-greening of or growth of vegetation in between pre and post imagery.\nMore information on dNBR can be found here: https://un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-burn-severity/in-detail/normalized-burn-ratio.\ndNBR data may be computed while the fire is in progress. This is intentionally done to prioritize rapid data availability for proactive disaster response but means data can change over the course of the fire.\ndNBR is produced by NASA’s Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) program, which generates surface products derived from satellite data. Therefore, dNBR data will be found in an opera collection.",

This layer can be used to threshold vegetation disturbance per a given sensitivity (e.g. disturbance of &gt;=20% vegetation cover loss). The sum of the historical percent vegetation and the anomaly value will be the vegetation cover estimate for the current year.\nThe process for visualization will exactly follow prior examples.",

    "text": "Summary\nIn this case study we have successfully visualized how NASA monitors wildfires with several satellite products observing the June 2025 Trout Fire in New Mexico. We demonstrated how to query the STAC collections and raster API to gather satellite imagery of a disaster. Using three satellite products, we could see areas that were ongoing signifcant burning (dNBR), areas that lost significant vegetation (VEG-ANOM-MAX), and what the burn scar looked like (Sentinel-2 color IR and true color). Using the various products, we can analyze how the fire was evolving and how it impacted the area, and how things like the areas of burning related to the lost vegetation spatially.",
